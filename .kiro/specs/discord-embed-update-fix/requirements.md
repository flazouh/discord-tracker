# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Discord pipeline tracker currently has a critical bug where the Discord embed message gets stuck on "Pipeline Started" status and never updates to show step progress or completion. This prevents users from seeing real-time pipeline status updates, making the tracking system ineffective. The issue appears to be related to state persistence and message updating logic in GitHub Actions environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the pipeline tracker, I want to see real-time updates of my pipeline steps in Discord, so that I can monitor progress without checking GitHub Actions directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pipeline step is updated THEN the Discord embed SHALL reflect the current step status within 30 seconds
2. WHEN multiple steps are executed THEN the Discord embed SHALL show progress for each completed step
3. WHEN a pipeline completes THEN the Discord embed SHALL show the final completion status with duration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline tracker to work reliably in GitHub Actions environments, so that state is properly maintained across different action invocations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracker is initialized THEN the pipeline state SHALL be persisted to disk storage
2. WHEN a step update occurs THEN the tracker SHALL load the previous state before updating
3. WHEN state loading fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the state file SHALL be cleaned up properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when the Discord integration fails, so that I can troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Discord API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN state persistence fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation and log the issue
3. WHEN message updates fail THEN the system SHALL retry the operation at least once
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the embed updates to be atomic and consistent, so that partial or corrupted updates don't occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating a step THEN the state SHALL be saved before attempting Discord API calls
2. WHEN Discord API calls fail THEN the local state SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without data corruption
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the embed SHALL reflect the correct current state
